# ðŸ“‚ SQL Code Examples Repository

Welcome to the **SQL Code Examples Repository**!  
This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts and examples that Iâ€™ve worked on while learning and practicing database management concepts.  

The goal of this repository is to serve as a **comprehensive reference hub** for SQL learners, enthusiasts, and professionals. It starts with the basics and will gradually expand into advanced topics and real-world use cases.
